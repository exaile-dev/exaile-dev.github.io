If you believe you have found a bug, you can click [here](https://github.com/exaile/exaile/issues/new) to report it.  You will need to create a github account before you can post a bug report.

You may want to check the [Frequently Asked Questions](http://exaile.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/faq.html) to see if your question is addressed there. Otherwise, the following ways are available to get support or ask questions you might have about using or developing Exaile:

**MAILING LISTS**

We run mailing lists for various purposes.

*   [exaile-users](http://groups.google.com/group/exaile-users) - A list for people who use Exaile. Open to discussion between users to communicate and help each other.  If you're having trouble using Exaile, ask here.

*   [exaile-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/exaile-devel) - Our primary list for general development discussion. Questions about the code, plugin development, packaging, etc. should go here.

**IRC**

We used to maintain the #exaile channel on freenode, but have abandoned it.
Please use the other communication avenues.
