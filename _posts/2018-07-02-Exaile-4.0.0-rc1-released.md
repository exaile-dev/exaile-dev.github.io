This release addresses issues reported with the Windows installer.

* Reduce size of Windows installer

Additionally, there are a lot of new strings in Exaile 4.0, so translation
contributions would be very welcome! To anyone interested in helping out, have a
look at the [translation guide in our
documentation](https://exaile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/contributing.html#translating-exaile)
and feel free to ask if you have issues.
