title: Exaile 4.0.0-beta3 released!
---

We're almost to 4.0!

This release comes highly recommended:

* Massive performance fixes -- Exaile can work with collections of over 50000 files now
* Drag and drop fixes
* Way too many other fixes ([click here for details](https://github.com/exaile/exaile/compare/4.0.0-beta2...4.0.0-beta3))
