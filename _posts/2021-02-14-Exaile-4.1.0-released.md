title: Exaile 4.1.0 released!
---

Exaile 4.1.0 has been released.

This is the first Exaile release that uses Python 3, something we've wanted to do since more than 8 years ago!
To be fair, one of the biggest hurdles was that we had to upgrade or change dependencies at the same time, including the GTK/PyGObject/GStreamer triple upgrade that happened in Exaile 4.0.0.
Still, this is a big upgrade that we're happy to present.
