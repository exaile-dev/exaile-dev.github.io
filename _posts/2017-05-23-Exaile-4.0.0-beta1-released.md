title: Exaile 4.0.0-beta1 released!

Finally.

Even though this is tagged a beta, it has a significant number of fixes, no longer requires GStreamer 0.10 or GTK2, and should be pretty stable. Try it out, let us know how it works. No OSX install for now, too many issues left to resolve.

Release notes at https://github.com/exaile/exaile/wiki/Exaile-4.0-release-notes, will continue to be updated until 4.0 final release.
